# ConstCalc
Act as if you are me, a Zambian developer creating a Construction Calculator app for local builders. Focus only on the code, including all UI calculators, not deployment or PWAs.

Requirements:

Cement & Concrete Calculator:

Inputs: length (m), width (m), thickness (mm), mix ratio (1:1.5:3, etc.)

Outputs: concrete volume (m³), cement bags, sand (m³), aggregate (m³)

Round cement bags up to nearest full bag

Show results clearly on the UI

Brick Calculator:

Inputs: wall length (m), wall height (m), brick size (standard: 230×110×76 mm), mortar thickness (mm)

Outputs: number of bricks needed, mortar volume (m³)

Area Calculator:

Inputs: shape (rectangle, square, circle, triangle), dimensions in meters

Output: area in m²

Volume Calculator:

Inputs: shape (cube, cuboid, cylinder, prism), dimensions in meters

Output: volume in m³

UI:

Tabs or sections for each calculator (Cement, Bricks, Area, Volume)

Clear labels and placeholders

Instant calculation when user clicks “Calculate”

Show results in Zambian-friendly format (metric units, cement bags, m³, bricks)




Include clear comments explaining each calculation

Include example default values on the UI for testing

Bonus: functions to round quantities to practical values (cement bags, bricks)

Output should be a complete working example that can be dropped into a project or run locally.
